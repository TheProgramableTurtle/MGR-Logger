# MGR-Logger
This bot extends the functionality of the main bot **metalgearrape**, aka **beenz-bot**, by allowing the main bot to send messages to a server without running the main bot on the server. This prevents members of the server from being able to access harmful commands and keeps the server completely safe. Since they are seperate bots, **MGR-Logger** cannot do anything **metalgearrape** can. 
## Recomended usage
Add the bot to the command server to provide status updates on the main bot. The bot may require admin permissions as it needs to be able to access other servers, but it will only be able to send messages to the server.
